# Security Controls

The goal of security controls is to:
1. Prevent security events
2. Minimize the impact of security events 

## Security control categories

There are 4 categories of security controls:
1. Technical
2. Managerial
3. Operational
4. Physical

Technical controls are implemented using technical systems. 
Managerial controls are related to creating security policies for people to best operate. 
Operational controls are implemented using people. 
Physical controls are related to limiting physical access. 

## Security control types

There are 6 types of security controls:
1. Preventive
2. Deterrent
3. Detective
4. Corrective
5. Compensating
6. Directive

1. Technical - IDS
2. Managerial -

### Compensating

This is a weak and unreliable security control because it is reliant on people. 

For example, asking all staff to use secure delete files instead of regularly deleting files.
